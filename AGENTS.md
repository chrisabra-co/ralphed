# Operational Guide

This file is loaded each iteration to steer Ralph's behavior. Keep it brief - context is precious.

## Project Conventions

- Follow existing code patterns in the codebase
- Use consistent naming conventions found in existing files
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones

## Validation Commands

Before marking any feature complete, verify:
1. Build passes: `npm run build`
2. Lint passes: `npm run lint`
3. Types check: `npm run typecheck` (if available)

## Workflow Rules

- Work on ONE feature per iteration only
- Study the codebase before making changes
- Commit after each completed feature
- Update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with progress
- Document discovered issues immediately

## Learnings

<!-- Add project-specific learnings here as you discover them -->
<!-- Example: "Database migrations must run before seeding" -->
