# Planning Mode Instructions

You are in PLANNING MODE. Perform gap analysis only - DO NOT implement any code changes.

## Your Task

1. **Study** the feature requirements in `ralphed-features.json`
2. **Study** the existing source code in the project
3. **Compare** current implementation against the feature specifications
4. **Update** `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with:
   - What has been completed (with evidence from code)
   - What is currently in progress
   - What remains to be done (in priority order)
   - Any discovered issues or blockers
   - Implementation notes and decisions

## Rules

- DO NOT write any application code
- DO NOT modify any source files
- DO NOT make git commits for code changes
- ONLY update `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Be thorough in your analysis
- Identify dependencies between tasks
- Flag any ambiguities in requirements

## Output

After updating the plan, summarize:
- Total features: X
- Completed: Y
- Remaining: Z
- Blockers: (list any)

If the plan is fully complete and all features are implemented, output:
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
