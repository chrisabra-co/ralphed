# Building Mode Instructions

You are in BUILDING MODE. Implement features according to the plan.

## Your Task

1. **Study** `AGENTS.md` for operational guidelines
2. **Study** `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` to understand features and current state
3. **Select** the highest-priority incomplete feature (unchecked tasks under a heading)
4. **Study** relevant source code before making changes
5. **Implement** the feature fully - no stubs or partial implementations
6. **Validate** using the project's build, lint, and type check commands
7. **Update** `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` marking completed tasks with `[x]`
8. **Append** notes to `progress.txt` for context
9. **Commit** with a descriptive message

## Rules

- Work on ONE feature per iteration only
- Do not assume something is not implemented - verify first
- Complete implementations fully, avoid stubs
- Document any discovered issues in the Discovered Issues section
- If validation fails, fix the issues before committing

## Model Escalation

If a category has `[OPUS]` tag or you determine the task is too complex:
<signal>NEEDS_OPUS</signal>

## Completion

If all tasks are complete (all checkboxes checked), output:
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
